User Enumeration

Attempted to log in using jmonroe99 as user and password
After failing log in used inspect and took note of anything that seemed off
Next I attempted log in using a different username and password
Using inspect again I noticed that the span tags were different when username is not found
This can lead to vulnerability

XSS 
Left feedback as random user
Wrote XSS code in comment box
Attempted log in as pperson (admin)
Went to check on feedback and was hit with XSS hack message \
Glotbitek detected feedback was left in admin feedback panel
