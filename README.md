# Pentesting-Live-Targets
User Enumeration
Attempted to log in using jmonroe99 as user and password
After failing log in used inspect and took note of anything that seemed off
Next I attempted log in using a different username and password
Using inspect again I noticed that the span tags were different when username is not found
This can lead to vulnerability
