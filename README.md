User Enumeration

Attempted to log in using jmonroe99 as user and password
After failing log in used inspect and took note of anything that seemed off
Next I attempted log in using a different username and password
Using inspect again I noticed that the span tags were different when username is not found
This can lead to vulnerability

XSS 

Left feedback as random user
Wrote XSS code in comment box
Attempted log in as pperson (admin)
Went to check on feedback and was hit with XSS hack message \
Glotbitek detected feedback was left in admin feedback panel

SQL Injection 

Found salesperson
Clicked on Daron Burke 
Attempted to sanitize salesperson.php query with ' or 1=1
This resulted in "Database query failed"
Reason: developer did not properly sanitize salesperson.php query 

Session Hijacking

Using mozilla fire fox (already had burp proxy set up)
Logged in as pperson
opened burp, and checked HTTP intercept
Found the traffic and checked session ID 
sent it to the repeater and changed the User agent to older verisions of the browsers I'm using
Using a different browser, I opened up Globitek and tried to log in using pperson 
This time however I was greeted with an error message. 
Reason: website does not check if UserAgent was the same when first logging in, allowing someone to log in with an outdated session ID

IDOR

Using red target 
Click on "find salesperson"
Click on Daron Burke 
Notice the .php?ID=1
Change that value to 2 and hit enter 
I repeated those steps, changing value 1-10
By changing value to 10, we were provided with information not meant for the public
Once again changing that value, this time to 11, we saw a profile of an individual who had just been fired
This proves that red target is susecptible to IDOR, because it does not verify ID param
